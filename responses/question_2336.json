    "gemini": "There's no single method to discover one's true passion.  It often involves self-reflection, exploration of diverse interests, and experimentation with different activities.  Consider trying new things, identifying activities that consistently engage you, and reflecting on what brings you fulfillment and joy.\n",
    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how someone can find their true passion in life. Hmm, where do I start? Well, maybe it's about reflecting on past experiences. I remember when I was a kid, I loved drawing and building things. Maybe those early interests can hint at what someone might be passionate about now.\n\nWait, but sometimes people's interests change as they grow up. So, maybe it's not just about what they liked as a child, but also about what they enjoy doing now. Like, maybe they enjoy cooking or helping others. That makes sense because passion can evolve over time.\n\nI think setting aside time to explore new things is important too. Trying different activities could help someone discover what they're really into. But how do they know what to try? Maybe they can take classes, join clubs, or attend workshops. That way, they can get a taste of various fields without committing too much time upfront.\n\nTalking to mentors or people who are passionate about their work could also be beneficial. They might offer insights or advice that someone hasn't considered. Plus, seeing someone else's passion in action could inspire them.\n\nAnother thing is following curiosity. If someone is naturally drawn to a particular subject, they should dive deeper into it. Reading books, watching videos, or taking courses could help them learn more and see if it sparks a passion.\n\nBut what if they try something and it doesn't feel right? That's okay, right? Not every activity will lead to a passion, and that's part of the journey. It's about experimenting and being open to different possibilities.\n\nI also wonder about the role of challenges. Sometimes, overcoming obstacles in a particular area can lead to a deeper appreciation and passion for it. So, maybe embracing challenges in different fields can help someone discover what they truly enjoy.\n\nAnd then there's the aspect of purpose. Finding something that aligns with their values and makes a positive impact might lead to a fulfilling passion. It's not just about what they enjoy doing, but also how it contributes to the world.\n\nPutting all this together, it seems like finding one's true passion involves a mix of self-reflection, exploration, seeking advice, following interests, embracing challenges, and considering the bigger purpose. It's a process that takes time and patience, and it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight.\n</think>\n\nFinding your true passion in life is a multifaceted journey that involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Reflect",
