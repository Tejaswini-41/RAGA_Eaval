    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking how someone can find their true passion in life. Hmm, that's a pretty common question. I need to break this down. First, I should consider the possible methods people use to discover their passions.\n\nReflecting on past experiences seems like a good starting point. People often enjoy certain activities without even realizing it. Maybe they can think back to what they loved doing as a child or what they've consistently enjoyed over the years.\n\nExploring new interests is another approach. Trying different things can help someone figure out what they really like. It could be through classes, workshops, or just experimenting on their own. Keeping an open mind is key here.\n\nSetting aside time for self-reflection might be important too. Maybe journaling or meditating can help clarify thoughts and feelings. It's about creating a space where they can really think deeply about what matters to them.\n\nIdentifying skills and strengths is something else to consider. If someone is good at something, they might enjoy pursuing it further. It's about aligning their natural abilities with their interests.\n\nSeeking feedback from others could provide valuable insights. Friends and family might notice things about a person that they don't see themselves, which can guide them toward their passion.\n\nTaking small steps is crucial. It's overwhelming to dive into something new all at once, so starting with small actions can help build confidence and interest over time.\n\nPatience is another factor. Finding a passion isn't something that happens overnight. It takes time, and it's okay if it doesn't click right away.\n\nI should structure these thoughts into a coherent answer. Maybe list each method as a point, explaining it briefly. It's important to keep the language simple and clear, avoiding any complicated jargon.\n\nWait, should I include all these points or just a few? The user asked for how someone can find their true passion, so providing a comprehensive list would be helpful. Each point offers a different angle, giving the user multiple strategies to try.\n\nI also need to make sure each point is concise. The user doesn't want a long essay but rather a straightforward guide. Each step should be a short, actionable item.\n\nLet me review each point again. Reflecting on past experiences, exploring new interests, self-reflection, skills and strengths, seeking feedback, taking small steps, and patience. Yeah, that covers a good range of methods.\n\nI should present them in a logical order, starting from self-reflection to",
