    "deepseek": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how someone can find their true passion in life. I've heard people talk about this a lot, but I'm not really sure where to start. Maybe I should begin by thinking about what passion even means. It seems like it's something you're really into and enjoy doing, but I guess it's more than that. It's probably something that gives you a sense of purpose or fulfillment.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that reflecting on past experiences can help. So maybe I should think about times when I felt really happy or fulfilled. What was I doing then? Maybe that can give a clue. But wait, how do I know if it's just a passing interest or a true passion? I guess it's something that sticks around even after the initial excitement fades.\n\nTrying new things might be another step. If you're not sure what you like, experimenting could help. But how do you decide what to try? There are so many options. Maybe start with things that interest you a bit, even if you're not sure. Volunteering or taking a class could be ways to explore without a big commitment.\n\nSetting goals sounds important too. If I find something I like, setting small goals to learn more about it could help build a routine. But what if I don't know where to start? Maybe breaking it down into smaller steps would make it less overwhelming.\n\nTalking to others who have found their passion might provide some insights. They could offer advice or share their experiences. But how do I find such people? Maybe through networking events or online communities. It might be a bit intimidating, but it's worth a try.\n\nStaying persistent is something I've heard about. It's easy to get discouraged if things don't go as planned, but keeping at it might eventually lead to finding that passion. However, how do I know when to keep going and when to pivot? It's a bit confusing.\n\nI also wonder about the role of failure in this process. If I try something and it doesn't work out, is that a bad thing? Maybe it's just part of the journey and helps me learn what I don't like. But it's hard to stay positive when things don't go as expected.\n\nAnother thought is about what truly matters to me. Maybe aligning my passion with my values can make it more fulfilling. If I care about helping others, my passion should probably involve that in some way. But how do",
