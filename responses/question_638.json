    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so I want to figure out how someone can find their true passion in life. Hmm, where do I start? Maybe I should think about what passion really means. It's like something that makes you happy and excited, right? But how do you actually find that?\n\nI guess one way is to reflect on past experiences. Like, when have I felt really happy or fulfilled? Maybe when I was doing a particular activity or working on a project. That could be a clue. But I'm not sure how to do that effectively. Maybe keeping a journal to track these moments could help. Writing down what I was doing, how I felt, and why it made me happy.\n\nAnother thing is trying new things. I've heard that stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to discovering new interests. But how do you know what to try? Maybe start with small things, like taking a class or joining a club. But what if you don't enjoy it? That could be discouraging. Maybe it's about being open to the experience regardless of the outcome.\n\nSetting goals might also help. If I have something I want to achieve, working towards it could reveal what I'm passionate about. But I'm not sure how to set the right goals. They should be challenging but attainable. Maybe breaking them down into smaller steps would make it manageable.\n\nSurrounding yourself with supportive people is another point. Friends and family can encourage you and provide feedback. But sometimes they might not understand your interests, or they might push you towards what they think is best. How do you balance that?\n\nBeing patient is important too. Finding passion isn't something that happens overnight. It takes time and self-reflection. But how do you stay patient when you're feeling stuck or unsure? Maybe setting aside time each day to explore different activities or reflect on your feelings.\n\nI also wonder about the role of purpose. Some people find passion through helping others or contributing to a cause. Maybe volunteering or getting involved in community projects could help identify what matters to you.\n\nAnother thought is about what you enjoy doing in your free time. Hobbies often reveal what you're passionate about. But sometimes people don't have hobbies or don't know what they like. How do you explore that?\n\nMaybe looking at your strengths and weaknesses can help. If you're good at something, that might be a clue. But sometimes people are good at things they don't necessarily enjoy. So it's a balance between",
