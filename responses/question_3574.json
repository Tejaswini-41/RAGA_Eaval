    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how someone can find their true passion in life. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I guess everyone has different interests and things they enjoy, but sometimes it's not clear what that one thing is that they're really passionate about. Maybe I should think about what passion really means. It's like something that excites you, something you can't stop thinking about, right?\n\nSo, maybe the first step is to reflect on what you've enjoyed doing in the past. Like, when you were a kid, what did you like to do? Maybe that's a clue. But sometimes people change, so it's not always the same thing. I've heard people talk about journaling as a way to track their thoughts and feelings. Maybe writing down what you enjoy each day could help identify patterns.\n\nAnother thing is trying new things. You can't know if you like something unless you try it. But how do you decide what to try? Maybe start with things that are related to your current interests or hobbies. For example, if you like cooking, maybe try a new recipe or take a cooking class. But what if you don't know where to start? Maybe taking a variety of classes or workshops could expose you to different areas.\n\nSetting goals might also help. If you have a goal, you might find yourself more motivated and discover what you're passionate about along the way. But it's important to set realistic goals, right? If the goal is too big, it might be overwhelming. Maybe breaking it down into smaller steps would make it more manageable.\n\nSurrounding yourself with supportive people is another idea. Having friends or family who encourage you can make a big difference. They might introduce you to new things or help you stay motivated when you're trying something new. On the other hand, negative people might discourage you, so it's probably better to avoid them when you're trying to find your passion.\n\nTaking time to reflect is also important. After trying something new, you should think about how it made you feel. Did you enjoy it? Were you excited about it? Reflecting can help you understand your emotions better and figure out what truly resonates with you.\n\nI also wonder about the role of challenges and setbacks. Sometimes when you're passionate about something, you face obstacles. How do you handle that? Maybe perseverance is key. If you really care about something, you'll keep going even when things get tough.\n\n",
