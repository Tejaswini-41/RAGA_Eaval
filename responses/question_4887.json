    "gemini": "There's no single method to discover one's true passion.  Exploration is key. This involves trying new activities, reflecting on what brings enjoyment and fulfillment, and identifying skills and interests.  Consider volunteering, taking classes, or pursuing hobbies to gain experience and self-awareness.\n",
    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how someone can find their true passion in life. I've heard a lot of advice about this, but I'm not sure where to start. Maybe I should think about what I enjoy doing in my free time. I like reading, but I'm not sure if that's a passion or just a hobby. Maybe I should try new things to see what I like.\n\nWait, maybe I should reflect on what I've enjoyed doing in the past. I remember when I was a kid, I used to love building things with Legos. That was a lot of fun. Maybe that interest in building and creating is a clue. But how do I turn that into a passion? I guess I need to explore it more. Maybe I can take a class or join a club related to building or construction.\n\nAnother thought: talking to people who have passions they love might help. I know a friend who is really into photography. She says it's her escape and she loves capturing moments. Maybe I can ask her how she discovered her passion and what keeps her motivated. That could give me some ideas.\n\nSetting small goals sounds like a good step too. If I'm interested in writing, maybe I can start a blog or write short stories. That way, I can see if I enjoy the process and if it's something I can commit to long-term. It's important to stay consistent, but what if I don't enjoy it? I guess I need to be honest with myself and try different things until I find something that resonates with me.\n\nI also wonder if my skills and strengths play a role. I'm pretty organized and good at planning, so maybe a passion that involves those skills would be a good fit. But I'm not sure how to connect that with something I'm passionate about. Maybe I can look into projects or hobbies where organization is key, like event planning or project management.\n\nAnother idea is to volunteer or take on a part-time job in areas I'm interested in. That way, I can get hands-on experience and see if I enjoy it. For example, if I'm interested in environmental work, volunteering at a local park or organizing a cleanup event could help me discover if that's something I'm passionate about.\n\nI should also consider my values. What matters most to me? If I value helping others, maybe a passion related to community service or mentoring could be fulfilling. It's important to align my interests",
