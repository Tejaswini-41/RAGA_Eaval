    "deepseek": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best strategies to overcome impostor syndrome. I remember hearing about this term before, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails. From what I gather, impostor syndrome is when someone feels like they're not as competent or skilled as others perceive them to be, despite evidence of their success. It's like they feel they're just faking it and might get caught eventually.\n\nSo, how do people deal with this? I think the first step is acknowledging that they're feeling this way. Maybe they need to recognize their emotions and understand that many others go through the same thing. But how does that help? Maybe by acknowledging it, they can start addressing it instead of ignoring it or letting it spiral.\n\nAnother strategy I've heard about is reframing negative thoughts.

Understanding that no one is perfect and that making mistakes is a natural part of learning and growth. But how does one actually embrace imperfection when they're so focused on being flawless? Maybe by practicing self-compassion and recognizing that it's okay to not be perfect all the time.\n\nFocusing on effort rather than just outcomes could also help. Instead of solely celebrating when they achieve a goal, they should also acknowledge the hard work and persistence they put in along the way. This shift in focus might reduce the pressure to always succeed and instead appreciate the journey.\n\nPracticing gratitude might play a role as well. Reflecting on what they're thankful for, including their own abilities and the",
