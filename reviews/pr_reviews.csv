#### 1. Summary of the Changes

This Current PR includes modifications across several files (`chatActions.ts`, `chatExecuteActions.ts`, `chatInputPart.ts`, `constants.ts`) primarily focusing on enhancing the handling of edit sessions and mode switching in the chat application. The changes introduce logic to handle editing sessions more gracefully, potentially discarding edits or confirming before mode switching. CSS modifications (though mentioned in the Similar PR) are not present in this Current PR.

#### 2. Potential Issues or Bugs

- **Unnecessary Condition Rechecking**: 
  ```typescript
  needToClearEdits: (!chatService.unifiedViewEnabled || (!configurationService.getValue(ChatConfiguration.Edits2Enabled) && (context.chatWidget.input.currentMode === ChatMode.Edit || switchToMode === ChatMode.Edit))) && requestCount > 0;
  ```
  This condition nestles multiple checks. The condition might be executed with unnecessary frequency or in incorrect context. Simplifying or revising it may be beneficial.

- **Potential Unhandled Cases for Mode Switching**:
  ```typescript
  if (switchToMode === context.chatWidget.input.currentMode) {
  ```
  This conditional branch implies a redundant switch to the same mode, which should explicitly handle no-op or a prompt to the user if switching to the same mode was indeed an accidental action.

- **Redundant Hover Setup**:
  ```typescript
  this.attachedContextDisposables.add(this.hoverService.setupDelayedHover(widget, { content: hoverElement, appearance: { showPointer: true } }));
  ```
  Repeated for no obvious reason, removing the redundancy might improve maintainability.

#### 3. Suggestions for Improvement

- **Refactor Mode Logic**:
  Create a utility function to handle mode switching and associated clear-edit logic, possibly extracting the logic into `handleModeSwitch` and encapsulating behavior.
  
- **Consolidate CSS Handling** (Not in this PR, but a suggestion):
  Though not part of the PR, the CSS handling should be centralized to prevent inconsistencies (from Previous PR).

- **Enhance Code Readability**: 
  Introduce a brief comment to describe the reason for certain checks especially nested within multiple conditions:
  ```typescript
  // If edits are present and in unification mode is disabled or in non-edits2Enabled mode, clearance is necessary
