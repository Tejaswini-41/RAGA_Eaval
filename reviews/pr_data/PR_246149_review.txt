**Summary of Changes**

The pull request appears to be refactoring the chat prompt attachment functionality in the VSCode workbench. The main changes involve:

* Renaming `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt` in `chatAttachPromptAction.ts` and updating the corresponding imports.
* Introducing a new option `skipIfImplicitlyAttached` in `attachPrompt.ts` to skip attaching a prompt if it is already attached as an implicit "current file" context.
* Updating the `isAttachedAsCurrentPrompt` function in `attachPrompt.ts` to check if a prompt is already attached as an implicit "current file" context.
* Refactoring the `chatInputPart.ts` file to use the new `skipIfImplicitlyAttached` option.

* The `skipIfImplicitlyAttached` option might change the behavior of the prompt attachment functionality, which could break existing workflows.
