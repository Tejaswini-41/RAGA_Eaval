Okay, I need to review this pull request and provide detailed feedback. Let me start by understanding what the PR is doing. It looks like the main changes are in two files: chatAttachPromptAction.ts and chatRunPromptAction.ts. 

In chatAttachPromptAction.ts, the import is being changed from attachPrompts to attachPrompt, and the function call is being adjusted. Instead of passing an array of resources, it's now passing a single resource. That makes sense if attachPrompt is designed to handle one resource at a time.

In chatRunPromptAction.ts, the import for runAttachPromptAction is being removed, and it's replaced with a direct import of attachPrompt. The function is then called with specific options. I notice that the options include skipIfImplicitlyAttached: true. I should check if this option is correctly handled in the attachPrompt function.

Now, looking at the similar PRs, I see that several files are involved, especially around handling implicit contexts and attachments. For example, in attachPrompt.ts, there's a check to skip attaching if it's already implicit. That seems related to the changes here.

I need to make sure that all these changes are consistent. One thing that stands out is the potential duplication in isAttachedAsCurrentPrompt. It's used in both attachPrompt.ts and chatInputPart.ts. Maybe there's a way to refactor this into a shared utility to avoid code duplication.

Also, the change from attachPrompts to attachPrompt might affect other parts of the code. I should check if any other files are using attachPrompts and whether they need to be updated. For example, if there are tests or other actions that rely on the old function, they might break.

Another point is the test coverage. Since the attachPrompt function is now handling single resources, the tests should be updated to reflect this. I should suggest adding tests for both successful and failed attachment scenarios, especially focusing on the skipIfImplicitlyAttached option.

I'm also concerned about the skipIfImplicitlyAttached option. If it's not properly handled, it could cause prompts to be attached when they shouldn't be, or vice versa. I'll need to review the attachPrompt function to ensure this option is correctly implemented.

Looking at the code quality, the new code seems cleaner, but I should check for any potential code smells, like unnecessary variables or unclear variable names. For example, in attachPrompt.ts, the variable names are descriptive
