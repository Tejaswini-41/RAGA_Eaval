## Summary - Key Changes and Their Purpose

The provided PR involves changes to the chat functionality in the VS Workbench, specifically focusing on how prompts are attached and run. The key changes include:

1. **Modifying Import Statements and Function Calls**:
   - In `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts`, the import statement and function call for `attachPrompts` have been updated to `attachPrompt`. This suggests a shift towards a singular prompt attachment approach.

2. **Updating Function Parameters and Return Types**:
   - The `attachPrompts` function, which previously accepted an array of values, has been replaced with `attachPrompt`, which seems to handle a single resource. This change is evident in `chatAttachPromptAction.ts`.

3. **Potential Refactoring in Related Files**:
   - Other files like `chatRunPromptAction.ts`, `askToSelectPrompt.ts`, `attachPrompt.ts`, and `detachPrompt.ts` might be impacted or related to these changes, given their proximity in functionality and location.

## File Changes - Specific Files Needing Updates

1. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts**:
   - **Before**: Imported `attachPrompts` and called it with an array of resources.
   - **After**: Imports `attachPrompt` and calls it with a single resource.

2. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts**:
   - Seems to be using the `runAttachPromptAction` which might need updates to align with the new `attachPrompt` functionality.
