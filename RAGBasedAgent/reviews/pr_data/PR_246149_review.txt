Okay, let me start by understanding the PR changes provided. The user has listed several files with before and after code diffs. My job is to analyze them thoroughly and structure the answer according to the six categories they mentioned: Summary, File Changes, Conflicts, Risks, Testing, and Quality. 

First, the summary: The main changes seem to replace the 'attachPrompts' function with 'attachPrompt' and introduce a 'detachPrompt' function. They've modified the attachment logic to handle individual files instead of multiple, track existing attachments via 'wasAlreadyAttached', and added a detach functionality. The purpose might be to handle file attachments more efficiently and reduce duplication.

Looking at each file:

1. **chatAttachPromptAction.ts**: Replaced import from attachPrompts to attachPrompt. They now import a different function. Need to ensure that the parameters passed are correctly adjusted here. The return value is now using the 'widget' from a tuple, so checking if structure matches.

2. **chatRunPromptAction.ts**: Major changes here. They split the import, replaced the function call to attachPrompt, added a parameter 'viewsService', and conditionally detachPrompt based on wasAlreadyAttached. Also, changed return types from void to IChatWidget. The function signatures have changed. I need to check if all dependencies (like viewsService) are correctly injected via accessor, and that returning 'widget' won't cause any discrepancies.

3. **askToSelectPrompt.ts**: Changed from attachPrompts to attachPrompt, which returns IAttachResult. The 'lastActiveWidget' now gets the widget from the returned 'attachResult.Widget'. Also, the add call is now a single file instead of a list, so the loop over "files" is removed, but in the after code, they're using selectedOption.value which is singular, implying processing a single file now. Check for any loops that were in the before that are missing now.

4. **chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts**: The 'add' method now returns a boolean indicating whether the file was already present. Previously, it was a method returning 'this'â€”indicating mutator, now returning a flag. This could affect other usages of 'add', as functions that expected the collection back will now get a boolean. Need to check all callers of add to see if they expect the boolean.

Detaching: The new 'detachPrompt' function in utilities was introduced. The implementation removes the
