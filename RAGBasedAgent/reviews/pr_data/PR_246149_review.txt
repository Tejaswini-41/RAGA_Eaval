## Code Review: PR Analyzing Prompt Attachment and Detachment

### 1. Summary - Key Changes and Their Purpose

The primary purpose of this PR is to refactor the handling of prompt attachments and detachments in the chat widget. The changes move from a `attachPrompts` function that handles multiple files to an `attachPrompt` function handling single files. A new `detachPrompt` function is introduced for removing attachments. The `attachPrompt` function now returns an object indicating whether the prompt was already attached. The changes also impact how the `chatRunPromptAction` interacts with prompt attachment and detachment. Finally, the `chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.add` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the attachment was successfully added.

### 4. Risks - Potential Breaking Changes with Evidence

* **`chatAttachPromptAction.ts` (Lines 5-6):** 
  The change from `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt` is a significant change. The original code likely handled multiple resources simultaneously. The new code only handles a single resource (`resource`). This is a potential breaking change if the calling code expected multiple attachments to be handled in one action.

* **`chatRunPromptAction.ts` (Lines 6-20):**
