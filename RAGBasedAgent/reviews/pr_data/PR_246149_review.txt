Okay, I need to analyze this PR thoroughly based on the provided code changes across multiple files. Let me start by breaking down each file and the changes made. The first step is to understand what each modification does and how they interrelate.

Looking at the changes, there are several files involved: chatAttachPromptAction.ts, chatRunPromptAction.ts, askToSelectPrompt.ts, attachPrompt.ts, detachPrompt.ts, and chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts. The key seems to be around refactoring the attachPrompts function into a new attachPrompt, and introducing a detachPrompt function.

Starting with chatAttachPromptAction.ts, the import of attachPrompts is changed to attachPrompt. The parameters passed have also changed, like moving from an array of files to a single URI. This suggests a shift from handling multiple files at once to handling one at a time. The use of { widget } from the result might indicate getting the widget object now instead of just a promise.

Moving to chatRunPromptAction.ts, there are several structural changes. They've moved from using runAttachPromptAction to directly using attachPrompt and then adding a detachPrompt afterward based on wasAlreadyAttached. This introduces new logic to check if the prompt was already attached and avoids detaching if it was, which helps in keeping state correctly. The return type here is now IChatWidget instead of void, so they're handling the widget more explicitly.

In the attachPrompt.ts, the function now returns IAttachResult which includes wasAlreadyAttached. The add method on the collection now returns a boolean indicating whether the URI was already present, which makes sense because the function now needs to know if it was added or existed before.

The new detachPrompt.ts was added, which handles removing a URI from the promptInstructions. The function's parameters include the URI and the widget. I need to check if this function is correctly referenced in the other files where detaching is done based on the wasAlreadyAttached flag.

The chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts in its add method now returns a boolean instead of 'this', which is crucial for the new logic in attachPrompt to know if it was previously attached. But the code provided for this file in the PR shows that the add function's return type is marked as "public add(uri: URI): boolean {" and the implementation returns true or false in certain conditions. Wait, in the before section, the original code had returns of 'this', and the after changes it to return a
