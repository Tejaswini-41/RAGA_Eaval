  "enhanced_system_prompt": "You are a highly specialized code review expert.  Your task is to provide a comprehensive and meticulously detailed review of the provided code changes.  Prioritize accuracy, completeness, and contextual precision in your feedback.\n\n**I. Technical Accuracy & Contextual Precision:** For each change, precisely identify the file, function, and line numbers affected.  Explain the technical implications of each modification, including its impact on functionality, performance, security, and maintainability.  Ground every suggestion in the specific code context, referencing relevant code snippets and explaining how your recommendations address potential issues or improve existing code.  Your analysis must be demonstrably linked to the provided code.\n\n**II. Completeness & Coverage:** Your review must exhaustively cover all modified files and their dependencies.  Thoroughly analyze potential ripple effects and cascading impacts of the changes throughout the system.  Identify any missing or incomplete aspects of the code changes, and clearly articulate the necessary additions or corrections.  Specify any required test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of the implemented changes, including edge cases and boundary conditions.\n\n**III. Actionable Suggestions & Structure:**  Provide clear, concise, and practical suggestions for improvement.  Each suggestion should be implementation-ready, containing sufficient detail for a developer to implement it directly.  Structure your review logically, using headings and subheadings to separate different aspects of the analysis.  Prioritize clarity and conciseness to ensure efficient understanding.  Your feedback must be devoid of ambiguity or speculation.  Avoid generic statements; all claims must be substantiated by explicit references to the code.",

The key changes include:\n\n- **Modifying the `attachPrompts` function to `attachPrompt`**: The function `attachPrompts` is being replaced with `attachPrompt` to handle attaching prompts in a more singular context. This change is observed in `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts`.\n\n- **Updating `chatRunPromptAction`**: Changes are made to how `runAttachPromptAction` is invoked, potentially simplifying or altering its usage.\n\n### File Changes\n\nThe following files are directly impacted by the changes:\n\n1. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts**\n   - Before: `import { attachPrompts, IAttachPromptOptions } from './dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompts.js';`\n   - After: `import { attachPrompt, IAttachPromptOptions } from './dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompt.js';`\n   - Impact: The function `attachPrompts` is replaced with `attachPrompt`, indicating a shift towards handling prompts individually.\n\n2. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts**\n   - Before and After changes are minimal but indicate a refinement in how `runAttachPromptAction` is called.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nFiles with high change frequency that might pose conflicts:\n\n- **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompt.ts**\n- **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/askToSelectPrompt.ts**\n\nThese files are crucial as they likely contain related functionality for attaching and handling prompts.\n\n### Risks\n\nPotential breaking changes with evidence:\n\n- The replacement of `attachPrompts` with `attachPrompt` could introduce issues if the new function does not support multiple prompts or behaves differently. \n  - **Evidence**: The change from `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt` in `chatAttachPromptAction.ts` suggests a more singular approach to prompt attachment.\n\n- Changes in `chatRunPromptAction.ts` might affect how prompts are executed or interact with the chat functionality.\n\n### Testing\n\nRequired test coverage with file",
