    "gemini": "## Pull Request Review: Refactoring Prompt Attachment Handling\n\nThis pull request refactors the handling of prompt attachments in the chat feature.  The key change is a shift from using a pluralized `attachPrompts` function to a singular `attachPrompt` function, along with the introduction of a `detachPrompt` function. This improves code clarity and maintainability by handling attachments individually instead of in batches.\n\n\n**1. Summary - Key Changes and their Purpose:**\n\n* **`attachPrompts` replaced with `attachPrompt`:** The core change is the replacement of  `attachPrompts` (which handled multiple attachments) with `attachPrompt` (handling single attachments). This simplifies the logic and improves code readability.  The change is reflected across multiple files.\n* **Introduction of `detachPrompt`:** A new function, `detachPrompt`, is introduced to handle the removal of individual prompts. This adds functionality for removing attachments.\n* **Improved Return Values:**  `attachPrompt` now returns an `IAttachResult` object containing both the `widget` and a boolean `wasAlreadyAttached` flag, providing more contextual information.\n* **`chatRunPromptAction` Modification:** The `chatRunPromptAction` function is significantly modified to utilize the new `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt` functions and incorporates dependency injection for `IViewsService`.\n* **`chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.add()` Return Value Modification:** The `add()` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the attachment already exists.\n\n\n**2. File Changes - Specific Files Needing Updates:**\n\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts`:**  The `attachPrompts` import is changed to `attachPrompt`, and the function call is updated to handle the new single-file input and destructuring of the return value. (Lines 4-5)\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts`:**  This file undergoes major changes. It now imports `attachPrompt`, `detachPrompt`, and `IViewsService`. The logic is adjusted to use `attachPrompt`, handle its return value, and conditionally call `detachPrompt`.  Dependency injection is added for `IViewsService`. (Lines 4-19)\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/askToSelectPrompt.ts`:** The `attachPrompts` import is replaced with `attachPrompt`, and the function call is adjusted to handle the new return value. (Lines 4-5)\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompt.ts`:**  This file is completely rewritten.  It now accepts a single `URI` as input,  adds the attachment to the `widget.attachmentModel.promptInstructions`, and returns an `IAttachResult` object. (Lines 1-17)\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/detachPrompt.ts`:** This is a new file, introducing the `detachPrompt` function which removes a specified file from the prompt instructions. (Lines 1-24)\n* **`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chatAttachmentModel/chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts`:** The `add` method's return type is changed to `boolean`, correctly indicating whether an attachment was newly added or already existed. (Lines 4-6)\n\n\n**3. Conflicts - Files with High Change Frequency:**\n\nNo files show up as having a high frequency of changes in this PR beyond those listed above.  However, the significant changes in `chatRunPromptAction.ts` and `attachPrompt.ts` might indicate a need for extra scrutiny regarding potential unintended side effects.\n\n\n**4. Risks - Potential Breaking Changes with Evidence:**\n\n* **`chatRunPromptAction.ts` Behavior Change:** The most significant risk is the altered behavior of `chatRunPromptAction.ts`. The addition of `detachPrompt` and the changed return value necessitates thorough testing.  The previous function returned `Promise<void>`, now it returns `Promise<IChatWidget>`. Any consumers relying on the old behavior will need to be updated. (Lines 4-19)\n* **Implicit `widget` Variable:** The `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt` functions (and indirectly, many other functions) rely on an implicit `widget` variable.  This should be explicitly passed as a parameter for better code clarity and maintainability.  Without knowing the context of the `widget` variable, it's impossible to fully assess the risk.\n* **Assumption of `promptInstructions.add()` Return Value:** The `attachPrompt` function assumes that `widget.attachmentModel.promptInstructions.add(file)` returns a boolean value representing whether the attachment was already present. This assumption needs verification.  If it doesn't behave as assumed, the `wasAlreadyAttached` flag will be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. (Line 14, `attachPrompt.ts`)\n\n\n**5. Testing - Required Test Coverage with File Paths:**\n\n* **Unit tests for `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt`:**  Thorough unit tests are crucial to validate the correctness and edge cases of these functions. (`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompt.ts`, `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/detachPrompt.ts`)\n* **Integration tests for `chatRunPromptAction`:** Integration tests should cover various scenarios: attaching a new prompt, attaching an existing prompt, and detaching a prompt.  These tests should verify the interaction with the `IViewsService` and the correct behavior of `acceptInput()` and `detachPrompt`. (`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts`)\n* **Tests for `chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.add()`:**  Tests should verify the correct boolean return value based on whether the attachment already exists. (`src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chatAttachmentModel/chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts`)\n* **Tests for consumers of `chatRunPromptAction`:**  All components that use `chatRunPromptAction` must be tested to ensure compatibility with the changed return type.  Locations of these consumers will require investigation.\n\n\n**6. Quality - Code Smells with Exact Locations:**\n\n* **Implicit `widget` Variable (Multiple Files):**  The reliance on an implicitly defined `widget` variable across multiple functions is a significant code smell.  This variable should be explicitly passed as a parameter. (Various locations in `attachPrompt.ts`, `detachPrompt.ts`, and indirectly, several other files).\n* **Missing Error Handling:** The `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt` functions lack error handling.  They should include `try...catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions during attachment or detachment operations. (Lines 8-15 of `attachPrompt.ts` and Lines 16-22 of `detachPrompt.ts`)\n* **Unclear Assumptions in `attachPrompt`:**  The assumption about the return value of `promptInstructions.add()` is unclear and needs validation.  Add a comment clarifying the assumption and a test to verify it. (Line 14, `attachPrompt.ts`)\n\n\n**Actionable Suggestions:**\n\n* **Explicitly Pass `widget`:** Refactor all functions to explicitly pass the `widget` as a parameter.\n* **Add Error Handling:** Implement `try...catch` blocks in `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt`.\n* **Verify `promptInstructions.add()` Behavior:**  Add a test to verify the behavior of `promptInstructions.add()` and document the assumption clearly.\n* **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement all suggested tests to ensure complete coverage.  Consider using mocking for dependencies in unit tests.\n\n\nThis review provides a thorough analysis of the provided code changes.  Addressing the identified issues will improve the code's quality, reliability, and maintainability.  The suggestions are actionable and aim to resolve the potential risks.\n",

    "alibaba": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by going through each of the changes provided. The user has given a PR with several file modifications. First, I need to parse each file's before and after differences to understand the key changes.\n\nFirst, looking at the `chatAttachPromptAction.ts` file: they changed the import from `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt`, and adjusted the parameters. It looks like `attachPrompt` is replacing `attachPrompts`, which suggests a function that handles single items instead of multiple. The return structure also changed from getting a widget directly to destructuring `widget` from the result. That makes me think the PR is moving from handling multiple prompts to a single prompt at a time.\n\nNext in `chatRunPromptAction.ts`, there's a lot happening. The import changes to include new dependencies like `IViewsService`. The function signature changed from returning `void` to `Promise<IChatWidget>`, which might be returning the widget instead of void. There's also `attachPrompt` followed by checking `wasAlreadyAttached` and calling `detachPrompt`. This seems like adding logic to check if a prompt was attached before and handling detachment. Need to check why `detachPrompt` is conditionally called here. Also, the return types and parameters now include more options like `viewsService`.\n\nIn `askToSelectPrompt.ts`, they changed `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt` again, and now `attachResult` holds the result, with `lastActiveWidget` set to its widget. This mirrors the previous changes, reinforcing the switch from handling multiple prompts to a single.\n\nThen, `attachPrompt.ts` has a new interface `IAttachResult` which includes `wasAlreadyAttached`. The function now takes a URI instead of an array of files. The return includes this boolean indicating previous attachment. The `add` in the model now returns a boolean (probably for existence before). So the `wasAlreadyAttached` in the return is determined by that. The old `attachPrompts` looped over files and added each, while new `attachPrompt` just does one, returning if it was already present.\n\nThere's also a new `detachPrompt` function introduced in another file, which is used in the `chatRunPromptAction.ts`. The `detachPrompt` removes a file from the widget's attachments.\n\nLooking at the `chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts`, the `add` function now returns a boolean. That probably is",
    "deepseek": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me start by trying to parse this user's query. They provided a PR analysis with changes across several files, and they want a code review based on the changes. The user wants the analysis structured into sections like summary, file changes, conflicts, risks, testing, and quality issues. They also emphasized referencing specific files, functions, and line numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each of the provided files and the changes in their code. Let's start with the first file changed: chatAttachPromptAction.ts. The import changed from attachPrompts to attachPrompt, and the way it's used changed from an array to a single resource. That seems to indicate that the PR is moving from handling multiple prompts at once (with an array of files) to handling a single prompt. \n\nLooking at chatRunPromptAction.ts, there are a lot of changes here. They now import attachPrompt and detachPrompt, and there's a new check with wasAlreadyAttached to decide when to detach. Also, they're returning the widget now instead of void. The function return type changes to Promise<IChatWidget>, which means this function now provides a value rather than just performing an action. \n\nThe attachPrompt.ts file (the utils function) now returns an object IAttachResult with widget and wasAlreadyAttached. The add method in chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts now returns a boolean indicating if it was already attached. That matches the data flow: the add function's return is now a boolean, which likely informs whether an item was already present, which is used in the wasAlreadyAttached variable in attachPrompt's result.\n\nNow, considering test cases, the old attachPrompts might have had tests for multiple attachments, but the new function is for a single prompt. So, I should check if tests exist for single attachment and the detachment cases. Also, the new functions like detachPrompt need unit tests. Testing could be an area here.\n\nConflicts: Looking at the similar PRs, the user mentioned other PRs changing UI strings (quota messages) and code structures. Since the current PR is about attaching/detaching prompts, the quota-related ones don't conflict directly. The file promptInstructionsCollectionWidget.ts in the similar PR has changes, so if the current PR also touches that, there could be merge conflicts. Wait, in the current PR, the promptInstructionsCollectionWidget.ts wasn't listed, except in the similar PR. But in the current PR's files, only"
