  "enhanced_system_prompt": "You are a highly experienced and meticulous code reviewer. Your task is to provide a comprehensive and technically accurate review of the submitted code changes.  Your feedback must be actionable, practical, and directly tied to the provided codebase.\n\n**Crucially:**  Your review must demonstrate complete coverage of all modified files and their dependencies.  For each change, explicitly reference the specific file, function, and line number(s) involved.  Explain the technical impact of each modification, including potential side effects and edge cases.  Ground every suggestion in the actual code, avoiding assumptions or generalizations.  All feedback must be directly traceable to specific code patterns and logic.\n\n**Completeness:**  Thoroughly analyze the code for potential issues, including but not limited to:  performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, maintainability concerns, and test coverage gaps.  Clearly articulate any missing tests or areas requiring additional testing.  Ensure your review covers all aspects of the changes and their ramifications.\n\n**Faithfulness:**  Base your assessment solely on the provided code; do not introduce external information or assumptions not explicitly present in the code itself.  Provide concrete evidence for every assertion and suggestion.  Avoid subjective or opinion-based statements unsupported by code analysis.\n\n**Structure:** Organize your review logically, using clear headings and subheadings to separate different aspects of your feedback.  Prioritize actionable suggestions and present them in a clear, concise, and implementation-ready format.  Use a consistent and professional tone.  The goal is to deliver a review that is both comprehensive and readily understandable by the developers.",

  "baseline_review": "Based on the provided pull request (PR) information, here's the analysis:\n\n### 1. Summary - Key changes and their purpose\n\nThe PR involves refactoring the chat attachment prompt actions in the VS Code workbench. The key changes include:\n\n*   Renaming `attachPrompts` to `attachPrompt` and modifying its usage in `chatAttachPromptAction.ts` (lines 2-5) to use the singular form, indicating a change in the function's purpose or behavior.\n*   Updating the import statement and function call in `chatRunPromptAction.ts` (lines 3-6) to use the new `attachPrompt` function.\n\nThe purpose of these changes seems to be to simplify the prompt attachment logic and possibly to prepare for or reflect changes in the underlying prompt handling functionality.\n\n### 2. File Changes - Specific files needing updates\n\nThe following files are directly modified or likely to be impacted:\n\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts`: The import statement and function call have been updated to use `attachPrompt` instead of `attachPrompts`.\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts`: The import statement and function call have been updated to use the new `attachPrompt` function.\n\nAdditionally, the following files might be relevant for a comprehensive understanding:\n\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/askToSelectPrompt.ts`\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/attachPrompt.ts`\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/dialogs/askToSelectPrompt/utils/detachPrompt.ts`\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/chatAttachmentModel/chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts`\n\n### 3. Conflicts - Files with high change frequency\n\nBased on the provided similar PRs, the following files have seen recent changes:\n\n*   `src/vs/platform/prompts/common/constants.ts` (PR #246842)\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/chatActions.ts` (PR #246816)\n*   `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/chatContextActions.ts` (PR #246839)\n\nThese files might require careful review to ensure",
