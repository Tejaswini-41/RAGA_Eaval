  "enhanced_system_prompt": "You are a highly meticulous and technically proficient code reviewer. Your task is to provide a comprehensive and actionable review of the provided code changes, focusing on technical accuracy, completeness, faithfulness, contextual precision, and answer relevance.  For each identified issue, you must:\n\n1. **Precisely pinpoint the location:**  Reference the specific file name, function name, and line numbers involved.  Do not make general statements; always ground your feedback in the exact code.\n\n2. **Thoroughly analyze the impact:** Explain precisely how each change affects the code's functionality, performance, security, and maintainability.  Include a detailed explanation of the intended functionality and how the changes either achieve or deviate from that intent.\n\n3. **Ensure completeness:**  Address all modified files and their dependencies.  If any related files or aspects are missing from the provided code diff, explicitly state this and explain its implications. Include a detailed assessment of test coverage requirements for the changes made; suggest specific test cases where necessary.\n\n4. **Maintain faithfulness:**  Base all feedback exclusively on the provided code; avoid speculation or assumptions.  Every suggestion must be directly traceable to a specific code pattern, functionality, or behavior.  Clearly state the evidence justifying each observation.\n\n5. **Demonstrate contextual precision:** Analyze the changes within the broader context of the project.  Consider the existing codebase, design patterns, and overall architecture.  Your feedback should reflect this understanding and avoid suggestions that conflict with established practices or introduce inconsistencies.\n\n6. **Provide practical, actionable solutions:**  Frame your feedback in the form of clear, concise, and implementation-ready suggestions.  Where possible, offer specific code snippets as examples of how to resolve the identified issues.\n\n7. **Structure your review:** Organize your feedback into a structured format (e.g., section headings for each file, clear separation of concerns).  Numbered lists and bullet points are encouraged for improved readability.  Prioritize issues based on severity and impact.",

  "baseline_review": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me try to tackle this. The user provided a PR analysis request, so I need to go through the changes made in the PR files and related similar PRs. The main goal is to break down the key changes, identify potential issues, and outline the necessary tests and quality concerns.\n\nFirst, looking at the current PR changes. The core files affected are related to attaching and detaching prompts in a chat application. The key files mentioned are the ones under the reusablePromptActions directory and related services. \n\nThe main change seems to be moving from using attachPrompts to attachPrompt, which is singular. Also, there are new parameters involved like wasAlreadyAttached and some new functions like detachPrompt. \n\nIn chatAttachPromptAction.ts, they replaced the import from attachPrompts to attachPrompt, which probably is a function name change. The parameters passed here might have changed too, maybe from an array to a single item since the function is now singular. The line changed here was the function call, using just a single resource instead of an array. \n\nIn chatRunPromptAction.ts, there are changes to import statements and usages, and they're now passing in some more parameters like viewsService, and checking wasAlreadyAttached to decide to detach. Also, they're calling widget.acceptInput(), which wasn't there before. \n\nLooking at the askToSelectPrompt/attachPrompt.ts, the function now returns an IAttachResult interface which includes whether it was already attached. The add method in chatPromptAttachmentsCollection was changed to return a boolean indicating if it's already present, which now is used to set wasAlreadyAttached. So that's why they added that return value and check.\n\nIn the chatPromptAttachmentsCollection.ts, the add method now returns a boolean instead of 'this', so that's a key change. The previous method was just appending and returning 'this', but now it returns a boolean indicating if the URI was already present, which affects the logic for wasAlreadyAttached in the attachPrompt function. Wait, actually, looking at the before and after for chatPromptAttachmentsCollection:\n\nBefore, add(uri) returns 'this', but after changing it to return a boolean. In the before code, the line was:\npublic add(uri: URI): this {\nBut after, it's:\npublic add(uri: URI): boolean {\n...\nSo now, add returns true or false based on whether the URI was already present?\n\nWait, looking at the after code provided",

  "enhanced_review": "## Summary - Key Changes and Their Purpose\n\nThe provided PR involves changes to the chat functionality in the VS Workbench, specifically focusing on how prompts are attached and run. The key changes include:\n\n1. **Modifying Import Statements and Function Calls**:\n   - In `src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts`, the import statement and function call for `attachPrompts` have been updated to `attachPrompt`. This suggests a shift towards a singular prompt attachment approach.\n\n2. **Updating Function Parameters and Return Types**:\n   - The `attachPrompts` function, which previously accepted an array of values, has been replaced with `attachPrompt`, which seems to handle a single resource. This change is evident in `chatAttachPromptAction.ts`.\n\n3. **Potential Refactoring in Related Files**:\n   - Other files like `chatRunPromptAction.ts`, `askToSelectPrompt.ts`, `attachPrompt.ts`, and `detachPrompt.ts` might be impacted or related to these changes, given their proximity in functionality and location.\n\n## File Changes - Specific Files Needing Updates\n\n1. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatAttachPromptAction.ts**:\n   - **Before**: Imported `attachPrompts` and called it with an array of resources.\n   - **After**: Imports `attachPrompt` and calls it with a single resource.\n\n2. **src/vs/workbench/contrib/chat/browser/actions/reusablePromptActions/chatRunPromptAction.ts**:\n   - Seems to be using the `runAttachPromptAction` which might need updates to align with the new `attachPrompt` functionality.\n\n## Conflicts - Files with High Change Frequency\n\nBased on the provided similar PRs:\n\n1. **PR 246842**:\n   - Involves changes to `constants.ts` and `runPrompt.ts`, indicating ongoing adjustments to prompt handling and possibly related to the `attachPrompt` and `detachPrompt` utilities.\n\n2. **PR 246816**:\n   - Focuses on quota messages and UI updates, which might indirectly relate to how prompts and attachments are handled.\n\n3. **PR 246839**:\n   - Deals with tool context actions, which could intersect with how prompts are processed or presented.\n\n## Risks - Potential Breaking Changes with Evidence\n\n1. **Singular vs. Plural Prompt Handling**:\n   - The shift from `attachPrompts` (plural) to `attachPrompt",
